        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
          <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability of being able to identify and understand your own emotions and also do the same for other's emotions.</p>
          <img id="wrap-image" src="../images/ccclaymoji.svg" alt="image of smiley face">
          <p>This can be demonstrated in empathy and actively listening to others. Other qualities include self-regulation/self-management which allows for a non-judgemental, accurate perception of yourself leading to confidence based on knowing your own values and also check-in with yourself on your own performance and decision making.</p>
          <p>By combining the above skills, it leads to better social skills as you're able to have empathy for others while managing your emotions and reaction to certain triggers that may arise within interaction with others.</p>
        <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
          <p>IQ stands for intelligence quotient and is a number/score that is measured by taking a standardised IQ test. It is for testing abilities such as logical thinking/reasoning, knowledge and memorisation. These are focused on things that can be seen and marked whereas EQ is something that is part of who the person is.
          </p>
        <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
          <p>EQ is important for an achieving a happy and fulfilled life. These can be related to workplace, relationship and hardship and the ability to be able to navigate these situations will lead to a better quality of life. When thinking about a workplace, you'd want someone that is able to communicate and work well together with other people. You'd also want someone who can control themselves in terms of emotion and understand where they are (self-awareness). This can help you learn more > self improvement and better work outcomes.</p>
          <p>The overall positive cycle is evident. It's easier said than done though, and it can also be a little difficult to understand this without criticising your identity/personality that may not fit all these boxes.</p>
