        <h4>What is Neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the brain's capability to change your brain by strengthening and/or changing your nerve cells. This results in the brain's ability to adapt, adjust and develop new skills through our behaviour.
        </p>
        <h4>How does the understanding of the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h4>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity allows people at any stage in their lives (babies and adults) to continue developing their brain in different ways. This understanding allows us to maintain an open mind for our potentials as it shows that we're not stuck in our old ways or that our brain stops growing once we reach adulthood but there's space and opportunity to continue gorwing.
        </p>
        <h4>How would I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?</h4>
        <p>
          I think this idea can really benefit me in the area of the current learning situation. The scientific facts that show you have potential to change how your brain works or have the ability to learn new things give hope and excitement for the things that could be possible. I am willing to utilise this idea as part of the basis of my learning throughout this course so that I can really hone into the capability of myself and trust/believe that this is something that can be accomplished.
        </p>
        <h4>What is growth mindset and how is is relevant?</h4>
        <p>
          Growth Mindset is having a belief that you and your mind has the capacity to grow. You believe that your talent/ability/intelligence can grow through effort and learning. This can really improve the outlook on your learning and life as it means that having this mindset, we believe that we 're able to take control of our own experiences and grow in a way we want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is provides ownership and autonomy for our experiences. When we have a growth mindset, we know for a fact that we can grow, and so everything that you do will eventually get you there. This will also help you look for ways that works for you, and let you enjoy that process.
        </p>
        <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
        <p>
          It was an eye-opener for me because I have a tendency to think that I am not good enough for anything that I am doing. This closes off opportunities to learn and can often turn to negative thoughts. It can be difficult to get out of that mindset once you're in it. Being exposed to the growth mindset allowed me to re-evaluate my mindset (which tends to be fixed) and include some of the growth mindset into my own. 
        </p>
        <h4>How can I integrate this and influence my learning journey?</h4>
        <p>
          I would integrate growth mindset by utilising the idea of 'yet'. This is saying you haven't reached the stage where you want to be 'yet' but with support from others, your effort and strategies, you're able to get where you want to be. This means you're never not good enough for anything but that you have the ability to be where you want to be. I would like to also integrate growth mindset via following strategies below:
        </p>
        <ul class="paralist">
          <li class="paralist">clarify your intention on why you want to work towards that goal. what is the motivation behind it and how would it make your life even more exciting?</li>
          <li class="paralist">view failure as part of the process of learning and growing -  not because you're not smart or good enough</li>
          <li class="paralist"> try and focus on your own development and progress rather than comparing it to others. notice when you're tying to seek approval from others or comparing yourself to others and bring yourself back to your own intention on why you're doing this.</li>
        </ul>
